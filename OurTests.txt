When selecting our test cells to test doorways, we made sure that we chose
Venus because it has a door that opens left, Mars because it has a door that 
opens right, Venus again because it has another door that opens down, and 
Uranus because it has a door that opens up. We also tested a walkway to 
ensure that it was not recognized as a doorway. 

When selecting cells to test for initials, we selected a cell in Mars, 
Venus, Uranus, and Mercury, as well as the closet and walkway, in order to 
get a variety of cells tested.
